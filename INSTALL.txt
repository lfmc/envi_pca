To build the program, simply run `make`
and copy the executable in the path where you
want to use it. It is required to have the
GSL development library installed in the standard
directory to succesfuly build the program. Otherwise,
it will be necessary to make minor changes in the
Makefile.

The program has been tested exclusevely in a machine
running Ubuntu 15.10. However, as it is written in
ANSI C, it should run in other operating systems just
as well.
